NOTE: This demo is highly recommended to be played with an actual headset, if possible.
Due to certain aspects of Tilia's spatial simulator, features like player scaling CANNOT work in an efficient fashion.


SPATIAL SIMULATOR:
- Press Mouse 1 to interact, which includes picking up objects (normal or distance grab) or selecting a lego/canvas option.
- Press Space to activate straight pointer. This is for selecting legos to open up the canvas that
can change their properties.
- Press Mouse 2 to enable the teleporter, this works just like the one out of the box from Tilia.
- Press Middle Mouse to enable player scaling. While holding, move right hand up/down to scale your size up/down respectively

UNITY XR:
- Press Right Trigger to interact, which includes picking up objects (normal or distance grab) or selecting a lego/canvas option.
- Press A (bottom button right controller) to activate straight pointer. This is for selecting legos to open up the canvas that
can change their properties.
- Push VERTICALLY UP on the RIGHT JOYSTICK to enable the teleporter, this works just like the one out of the box from Tilia.
- Press B (top button right controller) to enable player scaling. While holding, move right hand up/down to scale your size up/down respectively

BOTH:
- Pick up a lego piece and touch it to the top of any other piece. An indicator will appear that shows where the lego
will get placed. Let go of the interaction button to snap the lego in place where the indicator shows.
